The Windows executable for Circcash has been created but this executable has not been publicly posted. To request the executable file, please send a message to  
circcash9192020@protonmail.com and tell me your reasons for wanting to use Circcash. Since Circcash has not yet been signed, your Antivirus software may label Circcash as a  
'virus' and quarantine Circcash (you should be able to restore Circcash after it has been quarantined), so we recommend for you to use Ubuntu to mine and use Circcash instead of  
Windows at the moment.

Update 10/1/2020: This service is temporarily unavailable. Google Drive does not allow people to share this file, and the core development is unwilling to use any paid services to 
share this file without sufficient sponsorship. The core development will not simply do everything for free.

Update 10/2/2020: When I have tried to share this file on Google Drive, a spiteful and libelous entity has falsely flagged this file for abuse. This only means that I should not reveal
the Circcash Windows executable to anyone for the time being.
